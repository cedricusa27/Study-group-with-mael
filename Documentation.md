* ** Docker Objects?**

  When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.

* **What is the benefit of using Docker?** 

Docker uses fewer resources compared to traditional virtual machines. Because containers share the same underlying operating system kernel, they are much lighter and require less disk space and RAM. This allows more applications to run on a single machine, which saves hardware costs and eases resource management.
